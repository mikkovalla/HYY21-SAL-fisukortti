Maintainability can be increased by using known patterns and by avoiding anti-patterns. Microlith is an anti-pattern where everything depends on everything else. 
This has been avoided in final design. 

API gateway, that is the single entry point for all users, will be implemented. Different users need different data and API gateway provides the optimal API for each client. 
API gateway also simplifies the client by moving logic for calling multiple services from the client to API gateway. API gateway will increase complexity, 
but benefits are greater than drawbacks. The API Gateway authenticates the request and passes an access token, 
that securely identifies the requestor in each request to the services. A service can include the access token in requests it makes to other services. 
Access token can handle authentication and authorization quality attributes.

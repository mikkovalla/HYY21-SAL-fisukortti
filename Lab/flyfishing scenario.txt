Jack is going for business trip to Jyväskylä in first week of June. He knows that the meetings will end at 14:00 so he will have hte afternoon and evening
to do what he wants. Jack wants to go flyfishing for brown trout in one of the river rapids near Jyväskylä. Jack searches the listings with keywords 
'fly fishing' and 'Jyväskylä'. He clicks open the first listing for Kuusaa rapids. The listing says thet Kuusaa is private, and therefor Jack needs to buy
the private permit. The permits are for 24 hours and 12 hours. Kuusaa description states that the flow is still high at beginning of June so a heavier fly rod is recommended
which can handle heavy sinking lines. Jack doesn't have such setup with him. However, in the listing he can see the services of a local guide who rents fishing gear.
Jack contacts the guide to book the needed gear, books a permit through phone since the place owner does not have online booking available. 
Jack then checks the best way to get to Kuusaa, and the fastest and cheapest method of transportation is a taxi. Week later Jack is asked through his own profile
to provide a review for Kuusaa and for Juha's Guide services.

Paul looks for a place to fish for perch and zander near his home in Espoo. He searches the spots with search terms 'perch' and 'Espoo'. He is proposed 
several lakes and shoreline spots in Espoo. Paul runs through the listing and reads the reviews, only to realise that perch fishing from shore is not very
effective at this time of the year. However, the perch are scattered among deeper weed beds in aroun 4 to 6 meters of water. Paul looks at the listing for the spot
at Kivenlahti Marina and sees the advertisement to rent a boat through Skipperi for the day. Paul clicks the boat picture and is taken to Skipperi to finalize
his rental for the given time. After the rental is confirmed, Paul is returned to the listing for Kivenlahti Marina on fisukortti and he reads through the reviews,
checks the weather forecast for the spot provided by Foreca API, and decides to buy couple of jigs recommended by reviewers through the link to Happy Angler.
From the regulations section Paul realises he needs the national fishing permit, and clicks the link to the Er√§luvat website to buy one. 
Week later, Paul is emailed by fisukortti to provide a review of the spot.

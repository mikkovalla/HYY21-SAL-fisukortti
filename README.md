#### Design an architecture: fisukortti

Fisukortti is an online service which gathers fishing spots from Finland. Users can browse rivers, lakes, archipelago and shoreliness to find fishing spots that suit their need. The spot listing shows important info about the spot, regulations, recommended fishing methods and other nearby spots.
Users can search spots per fishing method, fish species, spot type or location. Users can review a spot and add pictures to their reviews. Users can add a specific spot to their 'Favourite Spots'-list. Spots can be viewed as a list or listed on a map.
Users can login and manage their reviews and see their favourite spots. Users can share their favourite spots on facebook, twitter, instagram and whatsapp.
The service is free to use and revenue model is based on affiliate sales and ads from an advertising aggregator.

Extra features are listing the boats available for rental at or near a spot from the finnish boat rental service Skipperi, list fishing guides in the area, and users can buy the recommendations of a fishing guide. Users will be able to buy fishing permits for private spots within the service. Users can view custom made lake and archipelago depth charts if these are available through Navionics API. Users can get access recommendation on the map from Google transport API.

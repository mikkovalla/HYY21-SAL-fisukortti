Susan, Emil and Jonathan digged some worms from their yard. They decided to go pole fishing in Espoo. Susan used Fisukortti-app with her phone to see where to go. It's everyman's right to go pole fishing without a reel using worm so Fisukortti showed all the water systems in Espoo. Susan added to search terms that they want to use bus to travel and shared their current location. Fisukortti gave water system options that are near a bus stop and timetables how to get there.
